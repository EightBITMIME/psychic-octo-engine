#What I learned
plnkr.co
javascript is case sensitive and ignores whitespace
Variable names use camelCase
Javascript reserved keywords
Double quotes allow you to include apostrophes
Escape with \
variable names cannot begin with a number
+ symbol concatenates
//comment
Array methods
triple === 
standard built in objects

scripts should go at the bottom of body

Be very careful with case / switch and break. Put the break in right after you make the case.
Cookies automatically handle conflicts and updates. 


I need to create a new set of functions to color the input box. I'll make it red for invalid and green for valid and saved to cookie.

email Regex:
/^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/
Phone Regex:
/^[+]?(1\-|1\s|1|\d{3}\-|\d{3}\s|)?((\(\d{3}\))|\d{3})(\-|\s)?(\d{3})(\-|\s)?(\d{4})$/g
