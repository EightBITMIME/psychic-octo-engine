#Build Notes
For the "CurrentSession" tables I tried several different approaches using floats and absolutes. Ultimately I just went with %based left aligned floats. It looks better and I kept running into top alignment problems.
In testing some of the mobile browsers I found the percentage based layouts did not work well but I found a way to do conditional layout for low width screens.
I removed the hardlines from the tables on current session. I needed them before I had CSS to tell where one started and one finished but now they just cause clutter.
I rebuilt the FAQ page to take advantage of CSS. It's not an unordered list anymore but the results are IMO better and I learned a lot about CSS rebuilding it.


#What I learned
- Add <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystylesheet.css" /> to add a stylesheet
- Always use external
- ID can only be used once per page
- Class can be used multiple times per page
- selectors:
    Whitespace - and
    > child selector
    : pseudo classes 
/* comment */
Keywords:
    thin, thick, larger
Specificity - the more targetted something is, the more powerful the match
Box Model 
If you use a background color, it's easier to see where your blocks are during layout
