#Build Notes
For the "CurrentSession" tables I tried several different approaches using floats and absolutes. Ultimately I just went with %based left aligned floats. It looks better and I kept running into top alignment problems.
In testing some of the mobile browsers I found the percentage based layouts did not work well but I found a way to do conditional layout for low width screens.
I removed the hardlines from the tables on current session. I needed them before I had CSS to tell where one started and one finished but now they just cause clutter.
I rebuilt the FAQ page to take advantage of CSS. It's not an unordered list anymore but the results are IMO better and I learned a lot about CSS rebuilding it.


#What I learned
- Add <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystylesheet.css" /> to add a stylesheet
- Always use external
- ID can only be used once per page
- Class can be used multiple times per page
- selectors:
    Whitespace - and
    > child selector
    : pseudo classes 
/* comment */
Keywords:
    thin, thick, larger
Specificity - the more targetted something is, the more powerful the match
Box Model 
If you use a background color, it's easier to see where your blocks are during layout


#What did not go well
I learned a valuable lesson about case sensitivity. When I uploaded my css files, one of them had an uppcase letter in the name that was not in my link definition. Windows is case insensitive so it just worked but when I uploaded it to the server, it just didn't work. I tried a few different browsers until I realized the difference in file names.


#What I would do differently
I would develop the CSS stylesheet in tandem with the HTML. It's easier to make sure IDs and classes are used appropriately when you understand how they interact. I would also have built the buttons differently to effectively use class identifiers.
I spent a lot of time working with absolute positioning that was a waste. I don't think I would do that again unless I really need to. A key deliverable for my personas is a consistent mobile experience and absolute locations do not work well with low rez screens.
