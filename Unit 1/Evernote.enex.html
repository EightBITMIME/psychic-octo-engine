I want to create a space on the web specifically designed to address the information imbalance between content providers and their customers. This sites core value proposition is to expose all of the information we can directly collect from the browser session connecting to the site, correlate this information with other public sources of open source intelligence, and present it back to users so they can make informed choices about how to best protect their identities on the internet. </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 18px;">Personas:</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Tim</div><div>57 Years Old</div><div>US Born, MBA</div><div>Privacy focused CEO of a privacy focused company.</div><div>Fan of Auburn Football and Duke Basketball.</div><div><img src="Evernote.enex_files/Image.jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" width="225"/></div><div>Cook, Tim (n.d.).

He would use this site as a way for current and potential customers to verify that their products protect their customers information. He would also use this site to develop additional privacy features to build into new products. This is something he sees as a competitive advantage.</div><div><br/></div><div>Approach to site usage:</div><div>Tim will use the site to validate the capabilities of his products. He will also use the site to identify new opportunities to improve the capabilities to shield users from additional collection. While not using the site often, he is keenly interested in understanding the nuances of the data presented and exploring the information for insights. He will visit the site primarily when preparing to launch new products or capabilities. </div><div><br/></div><div>Technical:</div><div>Tim will be primarily visiting using only his technology. This includes desktop and mobile browsers with no additional software loaded.</div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 1 - New Product Launch:</div><div>Tim is getting ready to launch a new version of his mobile operating system. This version contains a number of new capabilities to mask a users identity. This includes randomizing the user’s device identifier and additional limitations on it’s JavaScript engine. He will be looking to validate that the mitigation is working correctly and confirm his belief that users using his operating system cannot be tracked.</div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 2 - Marketing Privacy as a Feature:</div><div>In order to support his position that his focus on privacy is a differentiating characteristic, Tim will use the data identified by this site and will direct potential customers to evaluate this for themselves. The summarized views of visitor information by browser will provide a direct comparison of his products against his peers.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Sergey</div><div>44 years old.</div><div>Russian born PHD grad </div><div>Father of 2</div><div><img src="Evernote.enex_files/Image [1].jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" width="257"/></div><div>Brinn, Sergey.

He would use this site to validate that all of the technical capabilities his company is building into their technology are working as desired and give accurate results when queried. Sergey is passionate about eliminating passwords and needs to have accurate and consistent technical characteristics when his applications query an incoming device. </div><div><br/></div><div>Approach and Usage:</div><div>Sergey will be a frequent user of the site but will focus on only a few attributes at a time. He will access the site from several different browsers and configurations to ensure he can accurately identify an incoming user across different configurations. He will also be interested in comparing the output of different browsers across different platforms to make sure his systems have the greatest set of capabilities.</div><div><br/></div><div>Technical:</div><div>Sergey will primarily use his browser across a number of different operating systems. </div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 1 - Same user across multiple systems:</div><div>Sergey is attempting to make sure his applications can correctly identify users even if they are using different devices or browsers. He will connect to the site using a similar user profile across a few different systems to see what information he can use to identify an incoming user.</div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 2 - Technical capability as a competitive advantage</div><div>Sergey strongly believes that he makes the fastest, most capable browser and will use the aggregated browser information to show his browser is superior to his competitors. He will use the performance metrics and aggregate indicator reports to show that his browser can do what no other browser can do.</div><div><br/></div><div>Mark</div><div>34 years old.</div><div>New Yorker without a degree.</div><div><img src="Evernote.enex_files/Image [2].jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" width="251"/></div><div>Zuckerberg, Mark.

He would use this site to validate that the methods his project uses can consistently track visitors even if they are using various technical steps to prevent tracking. He will use the site to find technical characteristics he can use in place of common techniques like cookies to fingerprint his users.</div><div><br/></div><div>Approach and Usage:</div><div>Mark’s site usage will be primarily focused on identifying and defeating privacy features deployed in browsers in order to better track the actions of the people using his sites and services. His company relies on advertising revenue and the more information he can provide to advertisers, the more money they will pay his company. He will continually access the site from a variety of browser configurations with known attributesto identify attributes he can use to fingerprint the user.</div><div><br/></div><div>Technical:</div><div>Mark will use a variety of different ad blocking and privacy configurations across all of the common browsers to identify weaknesses.</div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 1 - Not-so Private Browsing</div><div>Mark thinks there is enough information present when using “private” browsing to get a reliable set of indicators to identify a user for the purpose of advertisers. To support this, he will connect to the site using a variety of different browsers running with privacy mode and “do not track” attributes set and review the output for common attributes.</div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 2 - Ad Blocking workarounds</div><div>Mark’s primary revenue model is strongly affected by ad blocking - a set of techniques that the browser uses to block incoming ads by blacklisting known advertiser networks. He will develop work arounds and have them hosted on the site to bypass the ad blocks.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Edward</div><div>34 years old.</div><div><span style="font-size: 13px;">Former US Government Contractor now residing in Russia.</span></div><div><img src="Evernote.enex_files/Image [3].jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" style="font-size: 13px;"/></div><div><span style="font-size: 13px;">Snowden, Edward.

He would use the site to build general awareness of how much information is available by directing people to the site to view the available information.</div><div><br/></div><div>Approach and Usage:</div><div>Edward will primarily use the site to demonstrate the evils of mass surveillance and will either demonstrate what is collected by a typical user browsing a site or will direct an interviewer to perform the same actions. He will visit sporadically and then primarily focus on a few key fields to make his point without digging deep into the data. As a privacy focused individual he will be keenly interested in having any of his data removed from the site as soon as possible.</div><div><br/></div><div>Technical:</div><div>Edward will use a variety of technical methods to disguise his browser and source location including privacy software, VPNs, and anonymizing proxies.</div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 1 - What the internet knows about you:</div><div>Edward will highlight how a few browser attributes used together can pinpoint your physical location and the sites you have visited, even without giving the site any special access.</div><div><br/></div><div>Scenario 2 - The dangers of your social graph:</div><div>Because the site will be aggregating and correlating open source intelligence data, it will be possible to identify additional information about who you associate with and their interests. This is something Edward can use to support his agenda and get people interested in protecting their privacy online.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 18px;">Requirements</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 13px;">This site’s primary goal is to attempt to display a single view of all of the information available for a given visitor. It will do this by heavily interrogating the incoming visitors system using all of the capabilities of the browser and then performing a series of lookups against public sources of information to enrich the data it has picked up.  It will need to store historical access to better display how users can be fingerprinted across different platforms. Open source correlation will have to have a mechanism for users to help choose the right result if multiple, conflicting results are found. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 13px;">It should include a mechanism for users to remove their data if needed.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 18px;">Mockup</span></div><div><img src="Evernote.enex_files/Notebook Scan on Jun 9, 2018 at 5_30_04 PM.png" type="image/png" data-filename="Notebook Scan on Jun 9, 2018 at 5_30_04 PM.png"/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 18px;">Sitemap</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Landing / Consent Page</div><ul><li><div> Current Session</div></li><ul><li><div>Session Info</div></li><li><div>Server Log Info</div></li><li><div>IP Info</div></li><li><div>OSINT Info</div></li><li><div>Access History</div></li></ul><li><div>Access history</div></li><li><div>FAQ</div></li><ul><li><div>Data Deletion</div></li></ul></ul><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 18px;">Diary</span></div><div><br/></div><div>For unit 1 I developed a website with personas, themes, scenarios, requirements, mockup, and site map. The theme I selected was a privacy focused website designed to show a visitor what can be discovered from their browser, source IP, and basic open source intelligence enrichment. I am very interested in this subject because I think a lot of people are unaware of just how easy it is to track their online habits and use this information to influence their choices online.  I chose to use notable company CEOs and well known security personalities to portray key points of view on consumer privacy and the internet and the different approaches used by major companies and out spoken critics on debates about privacy. This approach should make it easier to operationalize the different personas during future scenario testing. </div><div><br/></div><div>I had a few false starts on this, especially on the personas section. Before selecting the controversial company CEO approach, I started using different fake people and ultimately found that “normal users” would never use a site like this unless it was part of a larger debate and “developers” would not use this unless a large segment of the population was already using it. The hardest part of this section is the personas. It is challenging to come up with different use cases that don’t either completely overlap or are so specifically targeted to a specific attribute or feature that they only have one scenario. I tried a number of different mockup solutions but I found them all too complicated for what is fundamentally a straightforward site using a straightforward layout. </div><div><br/></div><div>In the future, when doing this sort of exercise, I think it would be easier to start with the persona section. Trying to come up with personas that fit the overall theme of the site seems harder than developing a site to address specific needs of personas. I think most real-world applications of this model follow this model. While I initially struggled with the personas section, I see the value of this and will apply it to future projects that involve developing capabilities from scratch.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think my background as an IT security professional made this somewhat easier as I have spent the last four years deeply involved in both sides of the privacy debate and I have had to simultaneously have deep and sometimes unsettling levels of information about the users I defend while working to make sure none of that information is intentionally or accidentally disclosed. In documenting the requirements and personas from this site, I discovered that, at least right now, my personal beliefs are strongly leaning towards the &quot;privacy is more important than security&quot; side of the debate.</div><div><br/></div></div></span>
