#Build Notes
Most of the examples / samples I found are missing the return component. I assume things like Angular, Node and Jquery make these easy bolt ons but getting the results of the script back into the page are not intuitive.
I used this script from Stack Overflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/41711747 - Author Sarika Koli, Posted Jan 18, 2017. I unwrapped the HTML elements so I could use it as pure Javascript.

This code is covered under the MIT license. To comply with it, I need to link back to the original work and optionally include the entire MIT license in the code to "future proof" the code.

The script uses the Webrtc capabilities in HTML5 to idenify a clients real IP address. In order for WebRTC to work behind networks using technologies like NAT (network address traversal), HTML5 supports a protocol called ICE (Interactive Connectivity Estalishment). This process allows endpoints to share thier IP information. This script 


#What I learned
Use External Javascript: <link  type="text/javascript" src="myscript.js" /> </script>
In page Javascript:
    <script type="text/javascript">
    // some Javascript commands...
    </script>
Ah, now I get it. You aren't linking the javascript in the head section, you are executing the script in the body section.
I figured out a way to write back info from the javascript - I just need to create a <p class="return variable"> to use the results.

#Errors
Couldn't get userinf0.js to work. I don't get any errors so I assume it's something wrong with their infrastructure.
