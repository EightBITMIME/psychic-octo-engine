#Build Notes
Most of the examples / samples I found are missing the return component. I assume things like Angular, Node and Jquery make these easy bolt ons but getting the results of the script back into the page are not intuitive.




#What I learned
Use External Javascript: <link  type="text/javascript" src="myscript.js" /> </script>
In page Javascript:
    <script type="text/javascript">
    // some Javascript commands...
    </script>
Ah, now I get it. Linking is only one part -to execute the script, you need to use this syntax:
<script type="text/javascript" src="privateip.js"></script>

#Errors
Couldn't get userinf0.js to work. I don't get any errors so I assume it's something wrong with their infrastructure.
